{"name":"Alfred-flik","body":"# What is \"AlfredFlik\"?\r\n \r\n\"AlfredFlik\" is an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension built using Python, that finds similar movies using Rovi's Metadata and Search API and then allow you to text them to a phone number using Twilio's API.\r\n\r\n## What is Alfred?\r\n[Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) is an award-winning productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web. Whether it's maps, Amazon, eBay, Wikipedia, you can feed your web addiction quicker than ever.\r\n\r\nThe real power of Alfred lies in it's [powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) that allows you to create your very own Terminal shell scripts, AppleScripts, workflows, search filters and file groups to extend Alfred.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nSay, you're a fan of Arnold and you watched Terminator last week with your friend. You can't get enough of the action and you wanna watch more movies along the same lines. You can now use Alfred-Flik - a handy extension that lets you specify a movie name and the name/phone number of the person you'd like to text the list of movies to. Alfred-Flik then queries Rovi's Metadata and Search API, pulls up a list of similar movies. It also finds the ratings of these movies via Rotten Tomatoes. Finally it sends it as an SMS to the phone number you provide using Twilio. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n1. [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) + [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)\r\n2. [Rovi API Key](http://developer.rovicorp.com)\r\n3. [Twilio API Key](http://twilio.com)\r\n4.
